As an Energy Auditor, my first step would be to analyze the flagged system data to identify potential issues that may be contributing to the high purchase costs.

Based on the data, I've identified several peaks in energy consumption during peak hours, which can indicate inefficiencies or opportunities for optimization. Here are some key findings:

1. **Air Compressor Peak**: The air compressor is peaking at 10 kW during peak hours (7-9 am and 4-6 pm). This could be an indication of over-sizing or inefficient usage.
2. **Pump Peak**: The pump system is also experiencing high demand peaks, reaching up to 12 kW during the same time period. This could be related to inadequate sizing or inefficiencies in the control system.
3. **Lighting Peak**: The lighting system is seeing a surge in energy consumption during peak hours, with some areas exceeding 1000 W per fixture. This may indicate over-specification or inefficient lighting controls.

To cross-reference these findings with high-cost assets, I've reviewed the plant's asset list and identified several high-cost equipment that are often associated with high energy consumption:

1. **Boiler**: The boiler is a significant energy consumer, but its actual peak demand during peak hours is relatively low (5 kW). However, this may be due to efficient controls or proper sizing.
2. **Packaged Chiller**: The packaged chiller's peak demand is also relatively moderate (8 kW), but it's worth noting that this system is often used for chilled water distribution and may have specific requirements.

Next steps:

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the air compressor, pump system, and lighting controls to identify potential areas for improvement.
2. Review the boiler and packaged chiller systems to ensure they are properly sized and maintained.
3. Evaluate the energy efficiency of the entire building or facility to identify opportunities for optimization through retrofitting or upgrading to more efficient equipment.
4. Consider implementing demand response strategies or smart grid technologies to better manage peak demand and reduce energy costs.

By following these steps, we can work towards reducing peak-hour surcharges and minimizing energy costs associated with high-cost assets.
