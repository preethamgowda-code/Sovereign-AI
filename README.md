# 🏛️ Sovereign AI Kernel

**Autonomous. Local-First. Enterprise-Ready.**

Sovereign AI is a cognitive operating layer designed to reclaim enterprise capital through agentic negotiation and predictive auditing. Built for the "Post-OS" era, it runs 100% locally on **Llama 3.2**, ensuring total data sovereignty for high-stakes industries.

## 🚀 The Mission (March 2027)
I am building this platform to prove that local-first, privacy-preserving AI can outperform cloud-based giants in enterprise efficiency. Our target is a fully autonomous, multi-vertical agentic workforce ready for market deployment by march 2027.

## 📊 Proof of Work: Capital Recovery
* **Recovered Capital:** ₹1,152 (Single Supply-Chain Audit)
* **Confidence Interval:** 85% Predictive Waste Detection
* **Data Leakage:** 0% (On-Premise Execution)

## 🛠️ Project Architecture
The system is divided into three core layers to ensure a clean "Separation of Concerns":
* **/core**: The Sovereign Kernel, State Management, and ChromaDB Memory.
* **/logic_engines**: Domain-specific logic for Healthcare, Energy, and Logistics.
* **/interface**: The Sovereign Shell (Alt+Space) for real-time human-agent interaction.

## 📓 Engineering Journey (Dev-Logs)
Unlike generated scripts, this project is built through iterative problem-solving. You can track the "Human" side of this development—including the bugs and refactors—in our logs:
