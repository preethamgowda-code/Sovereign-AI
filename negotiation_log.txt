    PRIMARY TARGET: Server_Rack_A
    DETECTED SYSTEM SAVINGS: INR 576
    
    LEVERAGE STRATEGY:
    1. AI Audit identified this asset as a core contributor to the INR 576 inefficiency.
    2. Demand a performance-based rebate or technical audit from the vendor.
    3. Shift operation to off-peak hours to mitigate surcharge risks.
